I checked firebase --version to see if it is working

I used the command flutter run so it will download all the dependencies

I linked activated flutterfire in the project using the commands

    firebase login
    dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

then add flutterfire to the path if it is not yet added

I then run 
    flutterfire configure --project=name-of-your-firebase-project
to create the file firebase_options.dart


Fix the following in order:
main.dart
    create the UserAuthProvider class with the filename auth_provider

create firebase_auth_api.dart

firebase_auth_api
